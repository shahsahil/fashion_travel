IBM Bluemix Account - sahilshah5@outlook.com

A demo was presented of the completely working app model and the backend server on the day of the hackathon.

Using Python and IBM Bluemix services to create a smart digital wardrobe.

The server.py consists of Web hosting script. It is in Python based script using Flask package for hosting. The app is not uploaded here.

App - Armario - The app is a personal digital wardrobe of an user. The user can upload a picture of the clothing to the app. The Visual Recognition API will then try to recognise the item and classify it accordingly. The user can ask for suggestions on what clothes to take when he is travelling. The app will give the list of items the user can take with him during travel and also the latest news of the place he is travelling to. 

IBM Bluemix Services used - 

1. Weather Company Data - to fetch the weather details of a location based on pincode and country code.

2. Visual Recognition API - To check for details(cloth type, etc.) in the uploaded image.

3. Cloud Foundry (python-flask) - to host the server (host working at the time of upload)

4. Alchemy News data API - to find the latest news of a paricular place

5. Kinetise - to build the client UI (Any application can be used as long as the requests format is correct)

The Kinetise UI consists of forms(static and dynamic). Please send an email to shahsahil007@gmail.com to get half hour access of the app. As the app is paid and can be used for only 30 minutes after compilation. 

All other bluemix services are also paid. I have only the free version access. So the access is limited. Please mail me at shahsahil007@gmail.com so that I can resolve them.
